# SF Health Cloud 

## Project Description
According to a recent study, two-thirds of patients will likely move to a better healthcare system if their expectations are not met. Organizations that are prepared to enhance the patient experience, however, have the potential to boost their income by 5% to 10% above pre-COVID levels in just a year.

A projected 8.4% cumulative annual growth rate (CAGR) is predicted for the Healthcare CRM market, which was valued at USD 14.3 billion in 2021. Growth in the market is expected to be fueled by rising demand for automation and structured data in healthcare companies.
